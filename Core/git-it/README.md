#NodeSchool Solutions

Open source lesson solutions associated with  [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/).

NodeSchool is an open source workshops that teach web software skills (fundamentals skills for NodeJS) that you can complete at your own pace using your terminal & text editor. I am using Atom + iTerm to complete these challenges.

The Git-It workshop does not include any actual code rather it includes interactive challenges to teach you how to use Git version control. I have included this repo here to maintain my file structure.
